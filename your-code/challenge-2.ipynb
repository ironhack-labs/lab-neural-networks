    "# ## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "# From the lesson and Challenge 1 you should have noticed that understanding the concepts \n",
    "# in neural network analysis such as *learning rate*, *epoch*, *optimizer*, *loss function* \n",
    "# and so on is essential for you to optimize the neural network models you build. \n",
    "# \n",
    "# In this challenge you will study several learning pieces that discuss the hyperparameters in Tensorflow. \n",

    "# After that, complete [this exercise](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/introduction-to-neural-networks/playground-exercises) \n",
    "# on tuning the Tensorflow hyperpamameters in the [Tensorflow Playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Finally, using what you have learned, try tuning the hyperparameters for the spiral dataset in order to reach training and test loss \n",
