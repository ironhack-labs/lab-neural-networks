<h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
<p>From the lesson and Challenge 1 you should have noticed that understanding the concepts in neural network analysis such as <em>learning rate</em>, <em>epoch</em>, <em>optimizer</em>, <em>loss function</em> and so on is essential for you to optimize the neural network models you build. In this challenge you will study several learning pieces that discuss the hyperparameters in Tensorflow. </p>

<p>After that, complete <a href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/introduction-to-neural-networks/playground-exercises">this exercise</a> on tuning the Tensorflow hyperpamameters in the <a href="https://playground.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow Playground</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, using what you have learned, try tuning the hyperparameters for the spiral dataset in order to reach training and test loss &lt;0.05 as shown in the following:</p>

<p>After you're done, submit a screenshot of your Playground including the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Epoch</li>
<li>Learning rate</li>
<li>Activation function</li>
<li>Features included</li>
<li>Hidden layers and neurons</li>
<li>Test and training loss</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Do not google for the end solution!</strong></p>
